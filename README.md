## Goal / Requirements 

1. Contains at least three models with corresponding tables, including a join table.

2. Accesses a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord.

3. Has a CLI that allows users to interact with your database as defined by your user stories (minimum of four; one for each CRUD action).

4. Uses good OO design patterns. You should have separate models for your runner and CLI interface.


## Set up 
This link is the clone to the application. 

git@github.com:DanTheMan114/ruby-project-alt-guidelines-sfo01-seng-ft-082420.git

The main directory, you've got a Gemfile that gives you access to activerecord, pry, rake, and sqlite3.

Remember to bundle install, before running. 

In the bin directory, you've got a run.rb file that you can run from the command line with ## ruby bin/run.rb ##

In config, you've got your database set up with Active Record, as well as all of your models from the app/models folder made available to your database.

There is no spec directory. Your goal is to use the program and submit feed back. 


## How to use 

1. To start the program user needs to type - ruby bin/run.rb - 

2. Next the user is able to make one of the seven selections. 

3. Each taking them through all the current features of Storage Land.

4. Following the instructions that are showen, and have fun. 

4. After creating an account dont for get to log back in and see your new wonderful locker. 

## Other info about teh project 

The biggest struggle i had with this would have to be the iteration, like the find by or the each statements.
Other that that i would say just the lack of creativity nothing fancy going on in here. 
I would say i should have GOOGLED more. 

## Three things i learned 

1. I learned that sleep is important 

2. Google is my lifeline if I dont have my instructers next to me 

3. I learned to keep trying different things and use terminology as much as i can. 

## Coming Soon 

1. I have added one of the many things i wanted to add if i had more time,  which is the suggestion box. 

2. I think with a team it would have been more fun, to use each others ideas and stuff like that.
